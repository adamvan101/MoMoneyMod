# MoMoneyMod
A mod for the game Cities: Skylines that allows you to add or subtract money

This mod adds a text box where you can input a dollar amount and it will add that to your money. Entered the wrong amount? Just put in a negative amount to subtract it. 

I'm new to modding this game, and I was unable to change the button icon, but it adds a "roads" button to the end of the toolbar. That will toggle the input box in the top left corner. 

Almost all of the code came from either here (City Vitals)[https://github.com/rob-williams/CityVitalsWatchMod] or here (Magic Mapper)[https://github.com/lxteo/Cities-Skylines-Mapper], so many thanks to them!
